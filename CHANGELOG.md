# [1.1.0] (Nobember 2024)
Updated to produce the figures in the revised version of the manuscript 
https://essd.copernicus.org/preprints/essd-2024-312/. The update adds code for producing the new tables 3 and 4,
as well as a revised version of figures 7 and 8. The main change is the addition of the Representative Key Risk 
categories (RKRs). 
Note: the code for producing the new or updated tables and figures can only work with the correspondingly
updated data (v 1.1.0), as the RKRs were not available in the initial version.
